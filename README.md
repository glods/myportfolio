# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This portfolio showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise in various data science and remote sensing domains. These projects highlight my ability to apply *machine learning techniques, data analysis, and remote sensing tools* to solve real-world problems.
Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
## Projects

### Churn Prediction for Insurance Policies
- **Objective:** Predict whether an insurance policy will be interrupted or not.
- This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will cancel their subscription.
- [Churn Prediction Project](https://github.com/glods/churn_prediction)

### Download Sentinel-2 Images on Google Earth Engine (GEE)
- **Objective:** Download various Sentinel-2 images on Google Earth Engine.
- This repository contains Python code to download images such as RGB, MNDWI, NDWI, S2cloudless layer, and cloud masks for RGB and MNDWI.

### Automated Flood Mapping System using Remote Sensing Data
- **Objective:** Detect and map areas likely to be flooded in rice growing fields.
- Utilizes Google Earth Engine API to download Sentinel-2 imagery and generate flood maps.
- Provides insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of flooding.
- [Automated Flood Mapping System](https://gitlab.com/irisat_senegal/automated_flood_mapping_system)

### Rice Flood Forecasting using Gompertz Model
- **Objective:** Predict dates and areas of future flooding using the Gompertz Model.
- The model is trained on historical flooding data from rice crops.
- Provides valuable insight for rice farmers and agriculture planners.
