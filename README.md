# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub portfolio.  
This portfolio showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise in various **data science** and **remote sensing** domains. These projects highlight my ability to apply *machine learning techniques, data analysis, and remote sensing tools* to solve real-world problems.  

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

## Projects

### 1 - Topic Modelling for Insights in Community Data
- **Objective:** Extract and analyze latent themes from text data using topic modelling.  
- Applied **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)** and related NLP techniques to uncover hidden structures in belief and causal statements across communities.  
- Delivered **visualizations (word clouds, topic distributions, bar plots)** to interpret results clearly.  
- **Outputs:** Comprehensive analysis, Quarto documentation, and abstract accepted at a scientific conference.  
- **Links:**  
  - Conference Abstract [https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-5509](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-5509.html)

### 2 - Paddy Rice Detection & Prediction (Remote Sensing + Gompertz Model)
- **Objective:** Detect and predict rice planting and flooding dynamics in the Senegal River Valley.  
- Combined **Sentinel-2 imagery, MNDWI index, and Gompertz growth modelling** to predict **flooded and planted areas** under varying conditions (including challenges of missing/cloudy data).  
- Achieved reliable predictions validated against government-reported data, supporting agricultural monitoring and planning.  
- **Outputs:** Flood detection pipeline, predictive analytics module, validation results.

### 5 - Automated Flood Mapping System using Remote Sensing Data
- **Objective:** Detect and map areas likely to be flooded in rice growing fields.  
- Utilizes Google Earth Engine API to download Sentinel-2 imagery and generate flood maps.  
- Provides insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of flooding.  
- **Link to repository:** [Automated Flood Mapping System](https://gitlab.com/irisat_senegal/automated_flood_mapping_system)

### 6 - Rice Flood Forecasting using Gompertz Model
- **Objective:** Predict dates and areas of future flooding using the Gompertz Model.  
- The model is trained on historical flooding data from rice crops.  
- Provides valuable insights for rice farmers and agriculture planners.  
- **Link to repository:** [Rice Flood Forecasting with Gompertz Model](https://gitlab.com/irisat_senegal/rice_flood_forecasting_using_gompertz_model)

- **Key Features:**  
  - **Version 1:** Pandas & GeoPandas for transformations.  
  - **Version 2:** Map-reduce paradigm for parallelization.  
  - **Version 3:** Dask for distributed computing with large datasets.  
- **Performance:**  
  - V1: Highest processing time  >1h  
  - V2: Moderate processing time ~36s  
  - V3: Fastest processing time ~7s
