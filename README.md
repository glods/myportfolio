# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This portfolio showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise in various data science and remote sensing domains. These projects highlight my ability to apply *machine learning techniques, data analysis, and remote sensing tools* to solve real-world problems.
Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
## Projects

### 1- Churn Prediction for Insurance Policies
- **Objective:** Predict whether an insurance policy will be interrupted or not.
- This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will cancel their subscription.

### 2- Download Sentinel-2 Images on Google Earth Engine (GEE)
- **Objective:** Download various Sentinel-2 images on Google Earth Engine.
- This repository contains Python code to download images such as RGB, MNDWI, NDWI, S2cloudless layer, and cloud masks for RGB and MNDWI.
- **Link to repository :** [Sentinel-2 Image Download on GEE](https://github.com/glods/download_sentinel2_images_on_GEE)

### 3 - Automated Flood Mapping System using Remote Sensing Data
- **Objective:** Detect and map areas likely to be flooded in rice growing fields.
- Utilizes Google Earth Engine API to download Sentinel-2 imagery and generate flood maps.
- Provides insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of flooding.
- **Link to repository :** [Automated Flood Mapping System](https://gitlab.com/irisat_senegal/automated_flood_mapping_system)

### 4 - Rice Flood Forecasting using Gompertz Model
- **Objective:** Predict dates and areas of future flooding using the Gompertz Model.
- The model is trained on historical flooding data from rice crops.
- Provides valuable insight for rice farmers and agriculture planners.
- **Link to repository :** [Rice Flood Forecasting with Gompertz Model](https://gitlab.com/irisat_senegal/rice_flood_forecasting_using_gompertz_model)

### 5 - Geo Transformations 

-  **Overview :** This repository showcases a geospatial data transformation using various techniques and libraries. It includes three versions of a geo-transform script (`geo_transform_v1.py`, `geo_transform_v2.py`, and `geo_transform_v3.py`), each demonstrating a different approach to efficiently convert location data in a CSV file into a GeoDataFrame with additional location and geometry information.
- **Key Features:** 
  - **Version 1**: Utilizes traditional pandas and geopandas for geospatial transformations.
  - **Version 2**: Implements a map-reduce paradigm to parallelize the processing of location data.
  - **Version 3**: Leverages Dask for distributed computing to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Performance Comparison:** With the same sample of data, 
  - **Version 3**: Highest processing time (e.g.> 1  h).
  - **Version 2**: Moderate processing time (e.g. 36 seconds).
  - **Version 1**: Fastest processing time (eg. 7s ).
